# LaTex online tools
Tools I found to make my life easier. Just click on the Heading.
## [Table Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/)
This tool lets you generate LaTex tables from .xlsx or .cvs files. It even lets you paste your data from word documents. Easy formatting and stylizing.
## [Tikz online](https://tikzmaker.com/editor)
With this tool you can create circuit diagrams with easy. This tool was a bit overwhelming for me so i used another [Circuitikz Editor](https://grex99.gitlab.io/circuitgui/) that is a lot more simpler. The drawbag was that i had to edit the LaTex code to include a proper electrical source.
